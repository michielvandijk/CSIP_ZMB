# Executive summary/Abstract


# Introduction

The government of Zambia has highlighted the linkages and interdependencies between climate change and agricultural development in most recent development and policy plans. As the the majority of people are living in rural areas and land use change contribute the largest part to greenhouse gas emissions, is essential to develop an effective and coherent approach to deal with the impact of climate change on the agricultural production and vice versa. 

At present the agriculture sector development strategies do not provide a coherent future roadmap to deal with climate risk. With support of the World Bank, the government of Zambia will draft the first Zambia Climate Smart Investment Plan (CSIP) that will inform a structured approach. The aim of this study is to contribute to the design of the CSIP by means of quantitative scenario modelling exercise using the GLOBIOM model developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). GLOBIOM is a spatially-explicit partial-equilibrium agricultural sector model that can assess future agricultural and land use change under climate change impacts. For this study the model will be modified and updated with country specific input information in order to better represent the agricultural sector in Zambia. The quantitative scenario analysis will help to identify and prioritise key policy interventions and investments to inform agricultural sector and climate change policy planning in Zambia for the the medium to long term. 

The GLOBIOM model will be modified and updated to simulate a selective number of scenarios that represent possible future agricultural pathways. The scenarios  are designed to capture both uncertainties in the drivers of future agricultural development pathways (e.g. population growth, economic development, technical change and climate change) as well as a number of policy options (e.g. adoption of climate smart technologies and practices). Scenarios that will be modelled include a business as usual (BAU) scenario and 2-4 additional policy scenarios. In addition, we will construct normative scenario that describes a desired agricultural pathway. To address the substantial uncertainties related to climate change impact and socio-economic drivers, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted in which yield, GDP and population projections are set to plausible upper and lower boundaries. 

The formulation of the scenarios builds upon the ideas and views that were expressed by a wide group of stakeholders from various Ministries, NGOs, policy think tanks and international organisations that was held in Lusaka on October 16th and 17th, 2017. At the workshop, the main drivers of agricultural development and land use change were discussed and different policy options and strategies were proposed to address climate smart agriculture in Zambia. Stakeholders also prepared a vision statement for climate smart agriculture in 2050.The output of the stakeholder workshop as well as a selection of recent policy sector and planning documents are used to design the scenarios for the modelling, which are described below.


# Literature review

A few papers assess the impact of climate change on agriculture in Zambia. @Jain2007 focuses on the economic impact of climate change using the Ricardian method. In this method, a regression model is estimated with net farm revenue as independent variables and a set of climate, hydrological, soil and socio-economic variables as explanatory variables. The analysis is conducted on a sample of 1015 households, including small-, medium- and large-scale households from 30 out of the 72 districts. The results point out that farm revenue is negatively affected by an increase in the November-December mean temperature and a decrease in the January-February mean rainfall, while a positive effect is found for an increase in the January-February mean temperature. This suggests that agriculture in Zambia will be affected by expected future change in rainfall and temperature induced by climate change. A major drawback of the Ricardian approach is that is fully relies on historical cross-section data and therefore is not able to assess the impact of future changes in the agricultural development related to economic growth and technical change.

@Thurlow2012 use a combination of a hydro-crop (HC) model and dynamic computable equilibrium (CGE) model to assess the impacts of future climate change on economic growth and household poverty in Zambia. The HC model is applied to simulate the impact of climate change on crop yield, whose results are fed into the CGE model to capture the economic effects. The HadCM3-B1a scenario, which represents a future climate where rainfall declines and temperatures rise, and two more extreme scenarios (2% increase in temperature combined with 15% rainfall above and below the historical trend) are used to model climate change up to 2025. The HC model indicates that in the HadCM3-B1a scenario  average maize yields will be reduced by around 1% in four out of the five agro-climatic zones in comparison to the historical trend. The exception is the Western part of Zambia, where maize yields are expected to increase slightly. Yield change is larger (in the range of -6% to +4%) in the more extreme climate scenarios. Incorporating the effects of climate change in the CGE model and assuming the continuation of historical climate variability, GDP is projected to decrease between -0.29%-point and -1.31$-point per year, while the poverty rate is expected to increase between 1.69%-point and 7.23%-point, all in comparison to a normal rainfall scenario. The simulation assumes that GDP growth will not increase between the baseline and 2025. The results are therefore net GDP growth as a consequence of structural change in the economy over time.

@Kanyanga2013 combine a crop model (DDSAT) and global economic model (IMPACT) to investigate the impact of climate change on future food security in Zambia. IMPACT is a partial equilibrium model that is used to simulate agricultural development at the global level (but including national representation) under a range of future scenarios. For this study, three socio-economic (pessimistic, baseline and optimistic) and four climate change scenarios (CNRM-CM3, CSIRO- mark3, ECHAM5 and MIROC3.2) were combined to account for the large uncertainty in both types of drivers. All three socio-economics scenarios show an increase in population and GDP in 2050 in comparison to the base year. The crop growth simulations broadly indicate that maize yield is expected to increase with sometimes around 5% in the Northern zone and decrease at sometimes more than 25% in the rest of the country. The results from IMPACT show that in all scenarios malnutrition among children under five years of age is decreasing and the availability of kilo-calories per capita is decreasing between 2010 and 2050 although change is less positive in the pessimistic socio-economic scenario. The model also shows that production and yield of maize is increasing and  net exports of nearly all modelled crops are declining. All results vary to some extent, depending on the climate scenario.


# Global-to-local modelling approach

Drivers of agricultural development in Zambia include both local and global factors. At the local level, national policies (e.g. agricultural support and investment plans), population growth and economic growth are key drivers, while at the global level, climate change and international trade are important factors. it is the interplay and interaction between these two sets of drivers that eventually will determine the future development trajectory of agriculture in Zambia. 

In this paper we adopt a global-to-local modelling framework that is able to incorporate both the global and local drivers of national agricultural growth. To capture the high level of uncertainty related to the future development of these drivers, we apply an exploratory scenario framework [@REF] both takes into account the uncertainties associated with climate change (e.g. precipitation and temperature change that affect crop yield) and the possible trajectories of socio-economic drivers of agricultural growth (e.g. population growth, economic development and technical change). The methodology is similar to the one used in recent global impact assessments of climate change [@REF], in which a matrix approach is used that combines five possible and realistic socio-economic futures with four emissions pathways. [@DEPENDS ON WHAT WE WILL DO]

The scenarios provide inputs for the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM) model, which quantifies the impact of the global and national developments on the agricultural sector in Zambia (Figure 1). The remainder of this chapter describes GLOBIOM and the modifications we made to tailor if for the Zambia analysis. The next section presents the socio-economic and climate change scenarios that are use to calibrate the model and quantify future agricultural development pathways.


## The GLOBIOM model

GLOBIOM [@Havlik2014] is a spatially explicit partial equilibrium model of the global forest and agricultural sectors. It has been used extensively to analyse the medium and long run effects of climate change [@add], deforestation [@add], food security [@add] and bio-fuel policies [@add] at the global and regional level. The supply side of the model is based on a bottom-up approach (from land cover, land use, and management systems to production and markets). The agricultural and forest productivity is modelled at the level of grid cells of 5x5 to 30x30 arc-minutes, input from crop and forest models. Demand is modelled at the regional level using [@add]. For this version the model is aggregated to X major regions (e.g. [@add]) and Zambia that together cover the whole world. 

The model computes market equilibrium for agricultural and forest products by allocating land use among production activities to maximize the sum of producer and consumer surplus, subject to resource, technological and policy constraints. The level of production in a given area is determined by the agricultural or forestry productivity in that area (dependent on suitability and management), by market prices (reflecting the level of demand), and by the conditions and cost associated to conversion of the land, to expansion of the production and, when relevant, to international market access. Trade flows are balanced out between different specific geographical regions. Trade is furthermore based purely on cost competitiveness as goods are assumed to be homogeneous. This allows tracing of bilateral trade flows between individual regions. GLOBIOM use a recursive dynamic approach combined with exogenous trends on population and economic growth to create future projections for key indicators, such as crop and livestock production and prices, land use change, greenhouse gas emissions and calorie availability. 

By including not only the bio-energy sector but also forestry, cropland and grassland management, and livestock management, the model allows for a full account of all agriculture and forestry GHG sources. GLOBIOM accounts for ten sources of GHG emissions, including crop cultivation N2O emissions from fertilizer use, CH4 from rice cultivation, livestock CH4 emissions, CH4 and N2O emissions from manure management, N2O from manure applied on pasture, and above and below ground biomass CO2 emissions from biomass removal after converting forest and natural land to cropland.

```


## Zambia adjustments

 To make the model suitable for a Zambia analysis, country level information will be added to GLOBIOM, including country specific agricultural production statistics, land cover maps and, if available, data on irrigation, costs and livestock.  The indicators which can be built based on this tool are: (a) projections for crop production, (b) livestock, (c) land use change, (d) prices, (e) trade, (f) greenhouse gas emissions, and (g) calorie availability. Where possible, indicators will be presented at different scales (i.e. grid, district and national). A GUI will be used to present and share the GLOBIOM results.

##	Business As Usual scenario

The Business As Usual (BAU) scenario assumes that trends that are typical of recent decades will continue in the future. As such it presents the baseline to which other scenarios can be compared, for example to assess the impact of certain policies on agricultural growth. The BAU scenario describes the key drivers that shape future agricultural development. To model a business as usual (BAU) scenario for Zambia, we use the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), which were developed as a backbone for climate change related assessments by a large consortium of researchers [@Kriegler2012; @VanVuuren2017a; @ONeill2017a]. The SSPs are a set of plausible and alternative assumptions that describe potential future socio-economic development in the absence of climate policies or climate change. They consist of two elements: a narrative storyline and a quantification of key drivers, mainly population growth and economic development. Projections have global coverage and are provided at country level, including Zambia. The SSPs can be combined with assumptions on climate outcomes, the so-called representative concentration pathways (RCPs), to derive a matrix that reflects an elaborate scenario framework to assess the impact of climate change and its mitigation under a variety of socio-economic conditions [@VanVuuren2014]. 

For the Business as Usual scenario we adopt the projections for SSP2: Middle of the Road [@Fricko2017]. The narrative of SSP2 can be summarized as follows:

_"The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Most economies are politically stable. Globally connected markets function imperfectly. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals, including improved living conditions and access to education, safe water, and health care. Technological development proceeds apace, but without fundamental breakthroughs. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Even though fossil fuel dependency decreases slowly, there is no reluctance to use unconventional fossil resources. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century as a consequence of completion of the demographic transition. However, education investments are not high enough to accelerate the transition to low fertility rates in low-income countries and to rapidly slow population growth. This growth, along with income inequality that persists or improves only slowly, continuing societal stratification, and limited social cohesion, maintain challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes and constrain significant advances in sustainable development. These moderate development trends leave the world, on average, facing moderate challenges to mitigation and adaptation, but with significant heterogeneities across and within countries."_ [@ONeill2017a].

Figure 1 depicts  historical trends and projections for GDP and population in the BAU scenario as well as two alternative SSP scenarios to assess uncertainties in future trends (see below). The scenarios describe the period from present to 2050, which is the time horizon agreed upon with the stakeholders at the inception workshop. [^1]. Assumptions on GDP growth and population growth for the rest of the world are presented in Figure A1 in the Annex. 

_Figure 1: GDP and Population projections for Zambia_

```{r fig_pop_gdp}
grid.arrange(fig_reg_gdp, fig_reg_pop, ncol=2)
```

The SSPs do not include projections for crop yields and livestock feed convergence efficiency, which are essential to model future agricultural productivity growth. We use yield projections from @Herrero2014 and @Fricko2017 that are estimated using the historical relationship between GDP growth and crop yield increase. We assume that these projections represent intrinsic productivity rates and reflect the increase in yield as a consequence of advances in knowledge and new technologies. They do not incorporate the yield shocks that occur as a consequence of climate change. In contrast to crop yield, there is much less information available on the past and future trajectories of livestock feed conversion efficiencies (the amount of feed required by per livestock category such as dairy, ruminant meat, pork and poultry) and how they will be influenced by climate change [e.g. @Bouwman2005; @Wirsenius2010a], Here, we use livestock feed conversion efficiencies from @Herrero2014 and @Fricko2017. Figure 2 presents past and future trends of key crops in Zambia. We also show the change in crop yield as a consequence of climate change impact (see below for details).

_Figure 2: Yield projections_

```{r fig_reg_yld}
fig_reg_yld
```

Finally, to model the BAU scenario, we also make assumptions on area of protected land, change in diets, food loss and waste, and trade at the global level. Table A2 in the Annex, presents details on these global scenario assumptions and how they are modelled in GLOBIOM. 


## Vision for Zambian agriculture in the year 2050

The vision reflects a normative and positive scenario of Zambian agricultural development. It will be used as a benchmark to assess to extent to which the implementation of various policy options, will bring the agricultural sector closer to the desired state. The vision is based on the input that was provided at a stakeholder workshop as well as several national and agricultural planning reports that have been published over the last decade by the Zambian government. In most cases, the national planning documents only provide normative target values for the short or medium term period (e.g. coming 5 years). In such cases, we extrapolated the values up to the year 2050. 

Table 1 summarizes the vision for Zambian agriculture. Figure X-X puts the vision into context by contrasting it with historical developments.

## What if CSA agricultural practices scenarios

After consultation with stakeholders, FAO and the World Bank, five CSA agricultural practices were selected for further impact analysis with the GLOBIOM model. The sections below provide background information as well as scenario assumptions for each of the practices. The assumptions are based on a wide number of sources, including FAO statistics, Zambia specific reports and data, scientific journal articles and input provided at two stakeholder workshops. 

### Conservation agriculture

#### Background

Conservation agriculture (CA) is build on three principles of agricultural management: (1) minimum mechanical soil disturbance, (2) crop rotation and (3) permanent organic soil cover [@Haggblade2003]. Since 1985, CA has been promoted in Zambia as a solution to low agricultural productivity caused by intensive tillage, lack of soil cover and burning of crop residue [@Baudron2007]. CA in Zambia, referred to as conservation farming, has a specific interpretation and consists of a package that involves five practices [@Haggblade2003; @Arslan2013]: (1) reduced tillage on no more than 15% of the field area without soil inversion, (2) precise digging of permanent planting basins or ripping of soil with a Magoye ripper (the latter where draft animals are available), (3) retention of crop residues from the prior harvest rather than burning it on the field, (4) rotation of cereals with legumes and (5) dry season land preparation. 

_Figure X: Agro-ecological zones in Zambia_

```{r fig_aez}
fig_aez
```

CA has mainly been promoted in the arid and moderate rainfall regions in the agro-ecological zones I, IIa and IIb (Figure @X1). There are no clear guidelines for the high-rainfall zone III, for which CA seems less suitable [@Baudron2007]. Despite the long history of CA in Zambia and the active promotion, national adoption rates are low. According to the RALS 2015 only 0.3% of farmers fully adopted CA practices, while adoption of the various elements (i.e. minimum tillage and crop rotation or crop residue retention) is higher. 

A large number of studies have investigated the low adoption rate of CA in Zambia. General factors, which have found to constrain the use of CA in other countries as well as in Zambia include [@Giller2009; @Arslan2013]: (1) Credit constraints: initial CA investment costs are high and benefits are usually realized after around four years; (2) labour: CA demands additional labour input for land preparation and weeding (although labour is saved for tillage activities) when it is implemented without pesticides (the common approach). This is regarded as the main barrier to adoption in Zambia; (3) competition for crop residues. Maintaining permanent soil cover can be costly as it demands access to seeds and residues cannot be used for other purposes such as livestock feed and fuel. 


#### CSA benefits and costs

CA can serve to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture by means of (1) enhancing soil C sequestration, (2) improving soil quality, N-use efficiency and water use efficiencies, and (3) reducing fuel consumption. @Thierfelder2013 present the results of on-station and farm trials in the Eastern and Southern provinces of Zambia to investigate the impact of CA on soil quality, soil moisture and maize yield. They find an average increase in yield between 75%-91% in comparison to plots on which conventional tilled is applied but only  after six cropping seasons. They also find an average carbon increase of 12% at the on-station plots, in comparison to a decrease of 15% for conventional control. This effect was not measured on the farm plots. @Erenstein2012 discuss on-farm trails in Zimbabwe and report a yield increase of 14%-81 of CA in comparison to conventional maize cropping.


#### Scenarios

The following parameters have been used to model the adoption and impact of conservation agriculture.

- Target crop: maize.
- Yield increase of 50% in comparison to conventional farming systems
- non-CO2/CO2 reduction of @X % in comparison to conventional farming systems [ONLY C sequestration, PROPOSE TO USE STEFAN's VALUES FOR NOW]

We assume the following s-shaped diffusion curve for the adoption of conservation agriculture between 2010 and 2050.

### Agro-forestry

#### Background

The term agro-forestry is used for a variety of agro-forestry systems (e.g. trees mono-cropped on arable or complex agro-forest systems). Here we use the term to refer to the integration of trees into annual food crop systems. More specifically, it involves crop ration or intercropping with fast-growing nitrogen fixing trees or woody shrub species. Agro-forestry is also sometimes referred to as 'evergreen agriculture', which is defined as "the direct and intimate intercropping of trees within annual crop fields" [@Garrity2010]. 

Most common agro-forestry models in Zambia are: Gliricidia-maize intercropping (Gliricidia), rotation of maize with Sesbania sesban (Sesbania), rotation of maize with Tephrosia vogelii (Tephrosia) fallows and Faidherbia albida intercropping (Faidherbia) [@Ajayi2009; @Garrity2010; @Shitumbanuma2012]. In the first three variations, the trees are grown on fallow land for 2-3 years, followed by 1-2 years of cropping after which a new cycle starts. Gliricidia is leguminous woody species that is able to re-sprout when cut back in contrast to the other two tree types. Agro-forestry involving this tree is therefore referred to as intercropping instead of crop rotation although the fallow-crop cycle is very similar between the two groups of tree species. The Faidherbia agro-forestry system is slightly different as there is no fallow-crop cycle and trees are grown alongside crops (i.e. continuous intercropping). Initial growth of Faidherbia is slow, which means that farmers only start to benefit after 1-6 years. It is estimated that currently about 500,000 Malawian farmers have Faidherbia trees on their farms [@Winterbottom2013]. The Zambian CFU estimates that the tree is now cultivated in conservation farming systems over an area of 300,000 [@Garrity2010]


#### CSA benefits and costs

Agro-forestry has the potential to: "maintain vegetative soil cover, bolster nutrient supply through nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling, generate greater quantities of organic matter in soil surface residues, improve soil structure and water infiltration, increase greater direct production of food, fodder, fuel, fibre and income from products produced by the intercropped trees, enhance carbon storage both above-ground and below ground, and induce more effective conservation of above and below-ground biodiversity" [@Garrity2010, p 197].

A number of studies investigated some of these benefits in more detail. @Shitumbanuma2012 presents the results of intercropping trials with Faidherbia (under) in combination with four different crops in Eastern Zambia and compares the yield with conventional cropping systems (outside) (Figure 3).  The impact is particularly large for maize, where yield doubles. @Sileshi2008 conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effect of  agro-forestry on soil fertility and maize yield in sub-Saharan Africa and presents similar improvements in production. @FAO2017 reports that mitigation impacts range between the annual sequestration of 5 to 15 t CO2 per hectare but only reaches potential after 20 years.

@Ajayi2009 estimate labour inputs and financial profitability of agro-forestry based management practices in comparison to conventional farming approaches in Eastern Zambia. The find that aggregated over a five-year cycle, labour inputs for agro-forestry were lower than fertilized maize fields but higher than non-fertilised maize. The main reason for this is that labour inputs in agro-forestry are concentrated in the first year during the establishment of fallows and in the third year when the fallow is cut down and the field sown with maize. For continuous maize cropping labour demands are relatively high in each year, in particular for fertilized plots where production is higher.

#### Scenarios

The following parameters have been used to model the adoption and impact of agro-forestry systems.

- Target crop: Maize
- Yield increase of 85% in comparison with conventional farming systems [NEED TO CHECK, seems high]
- CO2 reduction of ? % in comparison to conventional farming systems
- CO2 reduction of 5 to 15 t CO2 per hectare [FAO DRAFT CSA REPORT CHECK]
- non-CO2 reduction of ? % in comparison to conventional farming systems

We assume the following s-shaped diffusion curve for the adoption of agro-forestry between 2010 and 2050.

### Drought-tolerant maize varieties

#### Background

In view of a changing climate, drought tolerant maize (DTM) varieties are being developed that are able to deal with periods of drought and, in many cases, have other desirable characteristics, such as resistance to major diseases and high protein content. A major initiative is the CIMMYT Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) project, which released 160 DTM varieties in 13 African countries (including Zambia) between 2007 and 2013 [@Fisher2015]. All DTM varieties were bred using conventional methods and did not involve genetic modification. With 89%, the use of improved varieties of maize is high in Zambia in comparison to other countries. Following the inception of the DTMA project and the promotion of drought-tolerant varieties, the share of DTM has grown considerably from only 1% in 2006 to 23% in 2013 (Figure @x). 


#### CSA benefits and costs

The adoption of DTM varieties by farmers is expected to have two positive effects. First, DTMs are hybrid seeds that are expected to result in higher yields in comparison to traditional varieties. Second, DTMs are more resistant to fluctuations in precipitation, with the effect that the variance in yield is reduced over time. This is confirmed by @Wossen2017, who measure the impacts of DTMs on productivity, welfare, and risk exposure using household and plot-level data from rural Nigeria. Their results show that adoption of DTMs increased maize yields by 13% and reduced the level of variance by 53%. @Rovere2014a present an ex ante assessment of DTM adoption in 13 Sub-Saharan Africa countries (including Zambia), evaluating the benefits of an average yield increase as well as gains in yield stability. They find aggregate benefits in the range of USD 907-USD 1,535 million, under the assumption that DTM is adopted widely by farmers and depending whether conservative or optimistic yield improvements are used as the reference point. 

Similar to other hybrid seeds, DTMs require more fertilizer in comparison to traditional varieties to realize higher yields. Labour requirements and seed costs are similar to non-DT improved varieties [@Fisher2015].

Figure 6 shows the expected average yield gains of DTM varieties in comparison to that of other improved varieties. The results are based on field trials, including 273 trials in eastern and southern Africa over three years [@Banziger2006]. DTM yield is expected to be around 3%-20% higher under conservative assumptions and around 10-30% under positive assumptions (i.e. the highest yielding DTM varieties). According to expert opinion, DTM yield will result in around 50% higher yield (net of fertilizer use) in comparison to traditional varieties [@Rovere2014a]. Similar figures are presented in @Setimela2017, who compare new drought tolerant maize hybrids and open pollinated varieties against the best commercial varieties in East and Southern Africa under farmer management and on-station conditions.

#### Scenarios

The following parameters have been used to model the adoption and impact of DTMs.

- Target crop: Maize
- Yield increase of 50% in comparison with conventional (using non-improved traditional seeds) farming systems (to model this we probably should decrease the climate change shock with 50%).
- Yield increase of 20% in comparison with farming systems that use improved seeds already (idem)
- Costs increase of ? in comparison to conventional farming systems [Probably none as we already model costs for improved seeds?]
- CO2 reduction of 0 % in comparison to conventional farming systems
- non-CO2 reduction of 0 % in comparison to conventional farming systems

We assume the following s-shaped diffusion curve for the adoption of DTMs between 1997 and 2050.

##### Note: Total improved varieties is the sum of the adoption rate of open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) and hybrids (including DTMs). The diffusion curves are constructed using start and end year values combined with the general functional form of a generalised logistic function with seed type specific parameters (mid-point of 2005 and growth of 0.3. for improved varieties and mid-point of 2020 and growth of 0.2 for DTMs).


### Reducing post-harvest losses

#### Background

Following the food price crisis in 2007/2008, there is a renewed interest in reducing post-harvest losses (PHL). The World Bank [@WorldBank2011], estimated that around USD 4 billion annually can be saved in Sub-Saharan Africa by reducing the PHL in grains (mainly cereals and legumes) alone. This value is more than the value of total food aid received in the region over the last decade. There are four major reasons to address PHLs [@Sheahan2017]: (1) improve food security; (2) improve food safety; (3) reduce unnecessary input use and (4) increase profits for food value actors. 

PHL can take place at all stages of the value chain between the farmers field and the consumers' fork, which can be divided into five stages [@FAO2011]: (1) harvesting such as from mechanical damage and/or spillage, (2) post-harvest handling, such as drying, winnowing, and storage (insect pests, rodents, rotting), (3) processing, (4) distribution and marketing, and (5) consumption. 


#### CSA benefits and costs

Most data on PHL are spotty and often of poor quality. None of the available sources provide data for Zambia specifically. @FAO2011 estimated that total PHL in Sub-Saharan Africa amount to one third of total food produced (in volume). A more comprehensive analysis is presented by @Affognon2015, who conducted a literature survey of PHL in six African countries (but not including Zambia) and seven commodity categories. Figure X presents PHL estimates per crop over the total value chain. They also performed a statistical meta-analysis to provide more accurate figures. These are however only available for four crops due to lack of data. @Kaminski2014 use nationally representative household surveys for Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi. They only include on-farm PHL for maize and find values in the range of 1.4%-5.9%.

There is a consensus across sources that most grains and cereals are lost during post-harvest handling and storage on-farm, while loss of fresh produce, meat, and seafood is concentrated in processing, packaging, and distribution @Sheahan2017. In Sub-Saharan Africa, most PHL happens at the farm level [@FAO2011; @Affognon2015].

#### Scenarios

The following parameters have been used to model the reduction in PHL.

- Target crop: All crops in GLOBIOM
- Yield increase equal to the highest values in Figure 8 [do we model this by means of a yield shock and do we already take in to account PHL in the baseline?].
- Costs increase of ? in comparison to conventional farming systems [Maybe we should assume this is a 'free' technology?]
- CO2 reduction of 0 % in comparison to conventional farming systems [only indirect through land use change, etc)]
- non-CO2 reduction of 0 % in comparison to conventional farming systems

We propose the following s-shaped diffusion pattern for PHL between 2010 and 2050.
[Still have to decide? Gradual improvement or immediate?]


### Expansion of irrigated area

#### Background
Irrigation is regarded as an important CSA strategy to deal with the expected increase in water scarcity caused by climate change. According to the latest information (see Figure X), 155,912 ha of land is using surface, sprinkler or localized irrigation, which is about 30% of the economical irrigation potential [@FAO_IFC2014]. Nearly all area is owned or cultivated by large-scale commercial farmers, mainly producing sugar cane, soybeans and wheat. In addition, 100,000 ha is equipped with small drains, furrows and wells and mainly owned by small farmers.

##	Sensitivity analysis
At the stakeholder workshop three clusters of drivers of uncertainty were identified:

- Climate change (e.g. rainfall, temperature and, pests and diseases)
- Regional and international markets (e.g. global markets, external political stability and availability of external funds)
- Domestic development (e.g. internal political stability and changing dietary patterns)

This section presents the sensitivity analysis that is proposed to take into account these uncertainties on the projections.

### Climate change uncertainty
To analyse the impact of climate change We will conduct a sensitivity analysis to account for the high level of uncertainty associated with in the impact of climate change on crop yields. We combine the outputs of five general circulation models (GCMs): HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M, MIROC-ESM_CHEM and NorESM1-M with two crop models: EPIC and LPJmL to obtain a bandwidth of the yield shock that is caused by climate change in comparison to a no climate change scenario. Note that the yield shocks simulated by the crop models only account for the effect of long-run changes in precipitation and temperature. They do not capture extreme climate effects nor the potential increase in pests and diseases that affect plant growth. We only use the yield simulations for rcp 8.5, which is the most extreme climate scenario [@Riahi2011].

Figure @x shows the average (2 crop models x 4 GCMs) simulated crop yield change for a selection of crops in Zambia for the period 2010-2050. The impact of climate change on yield also depends on the farming system (i.e. irrigated, high input, low input or subsistence rainfed farming). Irrigated and high input systems are less vulnerable to climate change inputs are less water and nutrients are not limiting factors. As the majority of farmers in Zambia are subsistence farmers we only present the related crop yield results. The figure shows the large uncertainty associated with the crop yield simulations, which are both caused by the large differences in climate change scenarios as well as differences in crop model projections [also see @Rozenzweig2014]. The uncertainty is particularly large for beans, cassava and potatoes. Out of the 11 crops, climate change is expected to result in a negative yield shock for six crops as illustrated by a median value below zero. For five crops (barley, beans, cassava, rice and soy), a positive yield effect is found.

Note: Average of 2 crop models and 4 GCMs, using area harvested in 2000 as weights. Crop area in 2000 is used to calculate the national average yield. Data are for subsistence farming systems.

As both crop production and climate change are location specific, it is important to take spatial effects into account. Figure @X depicts the geographical distribution of the yield shock for the four most important crops in Zambia. Although maize is grown throughout all regions in Zambia, most is produced in the Eastern province for which yield loss is expected to be between 5 and 25%. In the Northern province, where there are potential yield gains, there is hardly any maize production because of the highly acidic soils. These findings suggest that maize production is highly vulnerable to climate change in Zambia. For the other three crops, yield change is more evenly distributed over the country which means location of production is less relevant.

We assume climate change has no affect on livestock 'yield'. Feed efficiency projections in the climate scenarios are therefore the same as in the BAU scenario.

### Socio-economic uncertainty

To investigate the uncertainties in the socio-economic projections, we will model and compare the results of two additional but SSP scenarios. SSP1: Sustainability—Taking the green road and SSP3: Regional rivalry—A rocky road, which represent two opposing types of scenarios. _"SSP1 with its central features of commitment to achieving development goals, increasing environmental awareness in societies around the world, and a gradual move toward less resource-intensive lifestyles, constitutes a break with recent history in which emerging economies have followed the resource-intensive development model of industrialized countries. To some extent, elements of this scenario can already be found in the proliferation of “green growth” and “green economy” strategies in industrialized and developing countries"_ [@ONeill2017a]. 

In contrast with SSP1, SSP3 describes a world that is characterized by fragmentation and sustainability is of no interest. SSP3 _"with its theme of international fragmentation and a world characterized by regional rivalry can already be seen in some of the current regional rivalries and conflicts, but contrasts with globalization trends in other areas. It is based on the assumption that these globalization trends can be reversed by a number of events_"[@ONeill2017a].  

SSP1 and SSP3 can be regarded as the scenarios that represent the bandwidth of the socio-economic spectrum, including uncertainties related to both external (global markets and the political situation) and internal conditions. This is illustrated by Figure 1 and 3, which shows that GDP, Population and yield projections of both scenarios on comparison to SSP1, the business as usual scenario. Projections for the rest of the world are provided in the Annex.
